Removes all the clutter from Fluffy's Stuffed Floors, leaving just the two vanilla floors that were really lacking: the wood floor (to use with Expanded Woodworking) and the metal tiles (grouped into one icon and enabled for modded metals). Both keep their vanilla stats and textures.

WARNING: Adding this to a saved game that already uses tiles from the regular Stuffed Floors will result in errors and those tiles will be deleted. I recommend removing those first. Other than that, this is perfectly save compatible.
